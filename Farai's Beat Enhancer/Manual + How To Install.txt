What is it for?

We've pieced together the best elements from the analog world and 
brought them over to FL Studio in order to create a tool which will help
you mix phat and warm records. 

Think of this plugin as a modded version of a mixing console tailored 
for enhancing beats and drum stems. Try it on the Master channel or
vocal bus, saturation is saturation...
